									<h3 class="major">VISUALISING DATA Reflective Piece</h3>
									
									<p>Throughout this module, I have engaged in various activities to enhance my statistical knowledge and data analysis skills. This reflection outlines my journey and learning experiences in each unit, especially emphasising learning the R programming language for statistical data analysis.
									   At the start of the module, I engaged in basic R data activities, which introduced me to the programming language and laid the foundation for the upcoming units and our final project. These initial materials related to R and the formative tasks, such as the Python exercise in the Numpy library, were crucial in building my computational skills as well. Learning and practising these basic data activities helped me to understand the importance of data manipulation and analysis tools.
									   In terms of statistical knowledge, delving into descriptive statistics was extremely important. Descriptive statistics are methods that use numerical and graphical techniques to summarise and characterise a dataset's main features. Using these statistics to organise and simplify large amounts of data makes it easier to understand (Mondal, 2024). Moreover, I have explored various types of data, data structures, and data management techniques, and I believe this will enrich my data analysis toolkit and empower me to tackle a wide range of analytical challenges with confidence. The module also covered mathematical topics such as vectors, matrices, and basic calculus, which were vital for developing my numerical skills.
									   I have also deepened my knowledge of fundamental concepts of statistics, such as probabilities and sampling, for making informed decisions based on data. It is said that three stages form an analyst's path in the field of data science: learning, doing, and presenting. If the audience is unfamiliar with inferential statistics, the third one is
									   the most challenging (Das, 2023). Interpreting the results of statistical tests, focusing on the significance of p-values and insights from confidence intervals, was challenging. Methods like confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, which were part of our math test, were initially confusing. However, I believe I have made substantial progress in understanding and interpreting these results accurately. This progress will help me present my findings effectively to various audiences in the future.
									   Besides these, my finance background gave me familiarity with other essential topics, which were correlation and regression analysis. Revisiting these topics in the context of R programming provided a fresh perspective and deeper understanding. Applying these techniques using R and seeing their practical applications in data analysis was particularly valuable.
								           During the units about parametric and nonparametric tests, I gained knowledge about their types and characteristics. Although I need more practice to solidify my grasp of these concepts, the initial exposure was beneficial. Understanding when and how to apply these tests is critical for accurate data analysis.
									   Creating summary statistics and contingency tables was straightforward yet insightful. These tables provide a clear and concise way to present data distributions and relationships between variables. Mastering this skill has enhanced my ability to summarise and interpret data effectively, especially during the final assignment. Using R's ggplot2 package, I learned to create various types of plots. Data visualisation is a powerful tool for presenting data insights understandably. This skill is particularly valuable for communicating results to diverse audiences.
								       	   The generality of the whole module was not new for me since I have a finance background, as I have mentioned. However, with the material in this module, I have refreshed my knowledge and have practised using R to manipulate datasets, produce plots and graphs, perform statistical tests, and generate summary statistics and contingency tables. All in all, I did not have too many challenges with R, even though I had no prior experience. R has an extensive package ecosystem, and it is always growing, evolving, and improving because of its vibrant community. Additionally, it serves as a vital tool for finance, an industry that mostly depends on statistical data (Simplilearn, 2023). Therefore, learning R will bring me a lot of advantages in my future career. Moreover, I also found the module seminars and the preparation process for them particularly helpful in consolidating my independent work and clarifying complex topics.
									   During the final assignment, I faced significant challenges with errors in my command and fixing them, which taught me persistence and problem-solving techniques. I had to attempt each descriptive and inferential statistic multiple times to ensure accuracy. Despite the frustration, this process led to a noticeable improvement in my R skills. Additionally, deciding which test I should perform was another difficulty, and this also forced me to do more research about statistical tests.
							                   In summary, the module has been instrumental in developing my data analysis skills and statistical knowledge, especially in using R. The challenges I faced and overcame have made me more confident and prepared for future data analysis tasks. I managed my time well in each unit and did not experience anxiety or any other negative feelings, as the content was straightforward. I felt a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction as I progressed through each unit, successfully tackling the challenges presented.
									   I look forward to applying these skills in real-world scenarios, particularly in the finance sector, and continuing to grow as a data scientist. Statistical analysis and programming language are fundamental skills that a data scientist should have (Crabtree, 2023). Therefore, the skills and knowledge gained from this module will be invaluable in my future career. I plan to apply these techniques to various data-driven projects, using R for statistical analysis and data visualisation. The confidence and problem-solving abilities developed during this module will support my continuous growth and success in the field of data science. In addition to the career benefits, I believe that the Numerical Analysis module has prepared me well for the rest of the master's programme, particularly for the projects ahead. From managing large datasets to conducting meaningful analyses, the module has equipped me with the tools needed to excel in future project work. I am confident this solid foundation will enhance my performance in the programme.
