									<h3 class="major">Unit 1</h3>
										
										
									<p>In this unit, we explored the scientific method, emphasising the distinction between deductive and inductive reasoning. To solidify our understanding, we completed a brief quiz on this topic. While the quiz seemed straightforward, it effectively highlighted the key difference: deductive reasoning starts with general premises and moves toward specific predictions, whereas inductive reasoning forms generalisations based on observations.
									Additionally, the unit delved into ethical considerations in AI and the importance of ethical standards, focusing on fairness, transparency, and privacy, with insights from Correa et al. (2023) and Deckard (2023). We also examined the ACM and BCS codes of conduct for computing professionals. Through our collaborative discussions, we analysed various case studies where computing professionals face ethical challenges, enhancing our understanding of how these principles apply in real-world scenarios. Moreover, we were provided with an outline of the entire module during our first Zoom session, which helped guide our learning throughout.

									<h3 class="major">Unit 1 Collaborative Discussion I: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct</h3>
									<p> <h3>Initial Post</h3></p>
									<p>
										The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct establishes essential ethical standards for computing professionals. This case study on malware disruption highlights Rogue Services, which facilitates client activities involving malware and spam while also hosting some legitimate web-based retailers. Rogue’s commitment to customer autonomy has led to the hosting of these malicious activities, despite pressure from major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and international organizations. Furthermore, jurisdictional limitations hinder effective government intervention against such services.


									Rogue's actions violate several principles outlined in the ACM Code:


									Principle 1.1 emphasises the importance of contributing to society and human well-being, recognising all individuals as stakeholders in computing. By hosting malicious activities, Rogue negatively impacts innocent stakeholders and thus violates this principle.


									Principle 1.2 stresses the importance of avoiding harm. Rogue's encouragement of destructive client actions directly contravenes this principle.


									Principle 2.8 mandates that computing resources be accessed only when authorised or compelled by the public good. Since Rogue intentionally offered services to those exploiting system vulnerabilities, their inability to limit access to malicious customers constitutes a breach of this principle.


									Principle 3.1 highlights the necessity of ensuring that the public good remains central to all professional computing work. In this case, Rogue's profit-driven interests have overshadowed the public interest.


									The British Computer Society (BCS) Code aligns closely with these ethical principles, advocating for public benefit through integrity, competence, and diversity within its membership. This further supports the ACM’s ethical standards focused on the public interest.


									In conclusion, this case underscores the urgent need for global ethical standards to prevent harmful activities and uphold professional integrity across borders. Establishing comprehensive guidelines can help ensure that computing professionals prioritise the well-being of society.

									<h3 class="major">Unit 2</h3>

									<p>We explored various aspects of a research proposal, including formulating research questions and conducting a literature review throughout the unit. Gaining an understanding of the literature review process is essential for identifying relevant theories, the methods used in previous studies, and research gaps, all of which will inform our research proposal, MSc thesis, and future work. I have selected my literature review topic, which aligns with my research proposal, and have begun creating an outline based on the guiding questions provided at the end of the unit. Additionally, our ongoing discussion on the code of conduct continues in the peer responses section, which is attached to this ePortfolio.

									<h3 class="major">Unit 3</h3>
										
									<p>Here, we explored three research methods: quantitative, qualitative, and mixed approaches, along with various data collection techniques and analysis strategies essential for conducting research studies. This exploration helped us begin addressing key questions regarding the most suitable research methods and data collection techniques for our research proposals. Additionally, we identified the necessary skills to complete the literature review and research project as a whole, gaining a clearer understanding of the competencies required for each phase of the process. Importantly, this unit also introduced us to research design and its various types, which are critical for structuring our studies effectively and aligning our methodologies with our research objectives. Furthermore, we participated in a peer review activity, which provided valuable feedback and insights into our work. We completed our first discussion by posting summaries, reflecting on key concepts, and engaging with peers to enhance our understanding.
