									<h3 class="major">Unit 1</h3>
										
										
									<p>In this unit, we explored the scientific method, emphasising the distinction between deductive and inductive reasoning. To reinforce our comprehension, we completed a brief quiz on this topic. While the quiz seemed straightforward, it effectively highlighted the key difference: deductive reasoning starts with general premises and moves toward specific predictions, whereas inductive reasoning forms generalisations based on observations. Additionally, the unit delved into ethical considerations in AI and the importance of ethical standards, focusing on fairness, transparency, and privacy, with insights from Correa et al. (2023) and Deckard (2023). We also examined the ACM and BCS codes of conduct for computing professionals. Through our collaborative discussions, we analysed various case studies where computing professionals face ethical challenges, enhancing our understanding of how these principles apply in real-world scenarios. Moreover, we were provided with an outline of the entire module during our first Zoom session, which helped guide our learning throughout.

									<h3 class="major">Unit 2</h3>

									<p>We explored various aspects of a research proposal, including formulating research questions and conducting a literature review throughout the unit. Gaining an understanding of the literature review process is essential for identifying relevant theories, the methods used in previous studies, and research gaps, all of which will inform our research proposal, MSc thesis, and future work. I have selected my literature review topic, which aligns with my research proposal, and I have begun creating an outline based on the guiding questions provided at the end of the unit. Additionally, our ongoing discussion on the code of conduct continues in the peer responses section.

									<h3 class="major">Unit 3</h3>
										
									<p>In this unit, we explored three primary research methods: quantitative, qualitative, and mixed approaches. We also examined various data collection techniques and analysis strategies essential for conducting research studies. This exploration allowed us to address key questions about the most suitable research methods and data collection techniques for our research proposals. Additionally, we identified the skills necessary to complete the literature review and the research project as a whole, gaining a clearer understanding of the competencies required at each phase of the process. A significant focus was placed on research design and its various types, which are critical for effectively structuring studies and aligning methodologies with research objectives. Importantly, I also participated in a peer review activity for the first time. This experience was highly technical and pushed me to adopt a more professional approach to academic reading and evaluation. We concluded our first discussion by posting summaries, reflecting on key concepts, and engaging with peers to deepen our understanding. These collaborative exchanges enriched the learning experience and provided valuable insights into research methodologies and design.

									<h3 class="major">Unit 4</h3>

									<p>This unit focused on qualitative research methods, particularly case studies, observations, and focus groups. These methods deepened my understanding of how to collect and interpret rich, descriptive data, which will be essential for refining my literature review and shaping my research approach. Additionally, we received group feedback on our discussion contributions, emphasising the need to further develop formal discussion techniques. This insight will help me improve my academic communication and engagement in future discussions. In this unit, I submitted my literature review outline for formative feedback, building on the concepts from Unit 3.

									<h3 class="major">Unit 5</h3>
									<p>The focus of the unit was on qualitative data collection methods, particularly interviews, survey methods, and questionnaire design. One key takeaway was the distinction between open-ended and closed-ended questions, along with the benefits and limitations of each. We also explored how using the wrong question types can negatively impact the quality of a questionnaire. Additionally, the chapter revisited concepts I am familiar with from previous modules, such as the definitions of population and sample. The introduction of pre- and post-testing concepts was especially enlightening. These methods are essential for evaluating and improving the clarity of surveys, ensuring that they effectively capture the necessary information. I now understand how these steps are crucial for creating a clear before-and-after visual, allowing researchers to assess the impact of changes in survey design. Most importantly, I gained a deeper understanding of how to analyse respondents' answers. I learnt that effective analysis requires careful attention to the structure of responses and how they align with the research objectives, which will be invaluable for my future research projects.
