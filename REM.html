									<h3 class="major">Unit 1 Collaborative Discussion I: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct</h3>
									<p> <h3>Initial Post</h3></p>
									<p>
										The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct establishes essential ethical standards for computing professionals. This case study on malware disruption highlights Rogue Services, which facilitates client activities involving malware and spam while also hosting some legitimate web-based retailers. Rogue’s commitment to customer autonomy has led to the hosting of these malicious activities, despite pressure from major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and international organizations. Furthermore, jurisdictional limitations hinder effective government intervention against such services.


									Rogue's actions violate several principles outlined in the ACM Code:


									Principle 1.1 emphasises the importance of contributing to society and human well-being, recognising all individuals as stakeholders in computing. By hosting malicious activities, Rogue negatively impacts innocent stakeholders and thus violates this principle.


									Principle 1.2 stresses the importance of avoiding harm. Rogue's encouragement of destructive client actions directly contravenes this principle.


									Principle 2.8 mandates that computing resources be accessed only when authorised or compelled by the public good. Since Rogue intentionally offered services to those exploiting system vulnerabilities, their inability to limit access to malicious customers constitutes a breach of this principle.


									Principle 3.1 highlights the necessity of ensuring that the public good remains central to all professional computing work. In this case, Rogue's profit-driven interests have overshadowed the public interest.


									The British Computer Society (BCS) Code aligns closely with these ethical principles, advocating for public benefit through integrity, competence, and diversity within its membership. This further supports the ACM’s ethical standards focused on the public interest.


									In conclusion, this case underscores the urgent need for global ethical standards to prevent harmful activities and uphold professional integrity across borders. Establishing comprehensive guidelines can help ensure that computing professionals prioritise the well-being of society.

										<h3 class="major">Unit 1 Collaborative Discussion I: The 4th Industrial Revolution</h3>
										<p> <h3>Summary Post</h3></p>
										
										<p>Throughout the discussion regarding the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), major incidents due to information systems failures and their consequences have been highlighted. Additionally, the discussion explored how 4IR is transforming industries by integrating physical, digital, and biological realms through technologies like AI, robotics, IoT, and blockchain (Schwab, 2016).

										In my initial post, I focused on the impact of 4IR on the finance sector, emphasising the cybersecurity challenges that arise from digital transformation. The Equifax data breach in 2017 served as an example, exposing the sensitive information of 147 million individuals and causing significant economic and reputational damage to the company (Upguard, 2024). This incident underscores the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures to accompany the rapid adoption of 4IR technologies.

										My peers contributed valuable insights to the discussion. Tala expanded on the growing need for data storage and management as Big Data continues to expand, particularly for financial institutions handling vast amounts of sensitive information. Aneil introduced the application of blockchain technology beyond finance, particularly in healthcare, highlighting the importance of considering environmental impacts and regulatory frameworks when adopting new technologies. Aminur emphasised the importance of human factors in cybersecurity, noting that human error remains a significant contributor to cyberattacks despite technological advancements.

										The discussion also aligned with the topics covered in Units 1, 2, and 3 of our ML module. Unit 1 introduced the timeline and the future of machine learning, which ties into how 4IR leverages AI and big data analytics to drive innovation. Unit 2 focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA), which is crucial in validating and preparing data for machine learning algorithms and making informed decisions. Lastly, Unit 3 on Correlation and Regression is relevant in understanding the relationships between variables.

										In summary, this discussion reflected the progress of 4IR, pointing out both opportunities and challenges in this transformation, while the three units provide essential knowledge about the key concepts driving this evolution.
