									<p>
										Throughout the module, I have deepened my knowledge related to the data-wrangling process and database management. I have learned to identify the problems and apply the appropriate tools, techniques, and methodologies. The topics that we have covered are data collection, the cleaning process of this data, normalisation for data integrity in designing datasets, regulation and compliance structure in data management, database management systems and models, and lastly, backup and recovery mechanisms for the implemented database. While we were studying these topics in each unit, we also started applying this theoretical knowledge to our group projects and individual reports.

										One of my biggest challenges as a beginner in this discipline and technology as a whole is applying what I have learned to practice in real-life situations, and my other problem is working within a team, which is something that I have to get better at to be successful in this field in the future. Therefore, my priority during the project was focusing on developing my collaboration skills and feeling motivated to work with other professionals, along with learning more about technical issues. To develop my collaboration skills, I have tried to express myself to my teammates at the beginning and explain what my level is in this area and why I would like to choose the cleaning part to contribute to our study. As a whole, my teammates were supportive, and our parts were more or less at a similar level at the end. That means we all put the same effort into this assignment to get the best result. All in all, this made me feel more confident and motivated about my future team projects. Additionally, that helped me to have a better understanding that one of the important things in these kinds of projects is that I need to be free during the conversations and stop being a perfectionist to learn more. Besides my personal development as a professional, the projects provided concrete insights into the logic behind database design and implementation. In terms of technical knowledge, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of database building. In the database design project, I was in charge of the data cleaning part of the logical database design. I have learned a lot about the phases, such as data planning, requirement analysis and fact-finding techniques, data capture, and data cleaning, by using Python and selecting effective and efficient technologies to generate business value from the data. Moreover, what a database management system is, how it works, comparisons among the DBMS, and all the technological tools such as cloud services and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that empower organisations to handle big data to store and manipulate it effectively. As a result, I took my first step to put my theoretical knowledge into practical applications.
										
										With our other assignment, which was the individual executive summary, I kept improving my skills and knowledge in creating a database, but in this assignment, we worked separately with the group, so I had to cover all modules as a whole to prepare the report, which forced me to have a concrete understanding of each topic. However, in my opinion, we had to have a meeting with the teammates beforehand and reach a consensus related to the implementation of the logical database that we created in Unit 6, which seems more logical to me. During my independent study, I struggled with the application side of database building since I do not have any prior practical experience in this area. However, I have enjoyed reading and searching for all of the techniques and state-of-the-art technologies that are being used in big organisations around the world. As a person, I am passionate about working independently, researching, and connecting all the points to understand the big picture. Connecting all this data and understanding how the system works motivated me to make progress in practice. For the team project, I spent as much time as expected, as mentioned in the module guidelines, but for the individual project, I spent much more than that. One of the most challenging tasks throughout the last assignment was selecting and evaluating the appropriate application. Especially, being cost-effective is an important aspect, and I need to research this issue to have a clear understanding. These are the technical skills and knowledge that I need to improve myself as a professional. A data scientist should be technically proficient in data collection and storage, data analysis and modelling, and data visualisation and presentation. Data scientists require not only technical expertise but also soft abilities like problem-solving, collaboration, commercial awareness, good communication, and critical thinking (BrainStation, 2023). To improve their abilities in handling data, data security, organisation, and long-term dataset sustainability, data scientists should be skilled in database architecture (Day, 2024).
										
										In summary, working alone or in a team has different advantages and disadvantages. Working alone has advantages such as more opportunities for individual creativity, the opportunity to focus more, more flexibility, and the ease of managing time.
										
										On the other hand, teamwork enables us to share new ideas, build connections, improve networks, and develop communication skills (Think Marketing, 2020). I have preferred to work independently rather than in a group in my professional life so far, but my preferences have started to change, and I believe I will have good collaboration with others while learning from them about changes in this evolving field. In real-world data science, challenges would be difficult to tackle without collaboration. The most important reasons for teamwork are diverse knowledge from various fields in a project, handling complex datasets by delegating tasks for efficient results, and consultation with executives to execute an effective project, as we did in the last assignment (KDnuggets, 2022). The most important takeaway from the whole module and projects enabled me to have a clear picture in my mind about my future goals in this career, which is that I prefer to be involved in project-based jobs rather than working on the same tasks in a company.
