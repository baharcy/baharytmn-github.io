									<h3 class="major">VISUALISING DATA Reflective Piece</h3>
									
									<p>
										This reflective essay delves into my transformative learning journey throughout the visualising data module, a pivotal experience as a beginner in data science. The module significantly enhanced my understanding and application of data visualisation techniques, focusing on tools like Tableau and R. This reflection will explore the development of my data analysis skills, statistical knowledge, challenges faced, feedback received, and the growth of various essential soft skills in the field.
The primary objective of the module was to develop a robust understanding of data visualisation, which is crucial for organisational decision-making. Two challenging projects formed the core of this learning experience. These projects, covering topics such as statistical model development and dashboard design, enabled me to practically apply the theoretical knowledge gained throughout the course. Through meticulous effort and perseverance, especially while grappling with new techniques and tools, I completed the projects. In this way, I gained confidence in becoming a proficient professional in this field.
The projects provided invaluable opportunities to deepen my understanding of the selection of appropriate chart types for different data sets to communicate data effectively. In the design of the dashboard project, working extensively with Tableau was a particularly significant development on this path. I leveraged Tableau to create a wide range of visualisations in practice, including line and bar charts illustrating market capitalization and trading volumes in the crypto market, insightful pie charts displaying cryptocurrency holdings distribution, and other informative charts for comprehensive market analysis. For instance, using Tableau, I can quickly identify trends in complex financial data. Mastery of Tableau was important, equipping me with essential skills for future data-driven projects and reinforcing my ability to

translate data into actionable insights. Businesses widely employ Tableau to analyse complex datasets efficiently, enabling them to make informed decisions and implement necessary adjustments to meet their company's evolving needs. This approach contrasts starkly with manual data combing, which is often impractical and time-consuming (Intellipaat, 2024). Thus, I believe this will significantly enhance my career prospects.
Regarding the first project, I developed my proficiency in R, which will also contribute to my career as a data scientist. Previously, I had only basic knowledge of exploratory data analysis, which plays a pivotal role in data analysis. I had the chance to understand this approach theoretically and apply it practically in the programming exercise project. This experience solidified my understanding of the fundamental principles of data analysis.
Navigating challenges such as data integration, time management, and technical complexities taught me resilience and the importance of continuous learning. For example, choosing accurate KPIs and integrating data sources was a significant challenge, which I overcame by making comprehensive investigations and seeking feedback from the tutor. These experiences sharpened my problem-solving abilities and reinforced the need for meticulous attention to detail in data visualisation projects. The seminars provided valuable insights and diverse perspectives, significantly contributing to my learning journey. Despite not having the chance to attend most of the seminars, I followed all the recordings afterwards, ensuring I did not miss any crucial information. One of the critical answers from the seminars I have learned is that there is more than one version of Tableau to design a dashboard. As a result, I had to repeat the same task due to my lack of knowledge, but this also made me use it easily.


On the other hand, the moduleâ€™s emphasis on critical thinking and analysis pushed me to explore new statistical techniques and methodologies, expanding my toolkit for interpreting and presenting data effectively. Particularly, the first project and related seminars allowed me to develop my statistical skills. This was also challenging, but since I was familiar with some of the topics, I believe I managed this process successfully. Shortly, I was fully satisfied with it, apart from the cost function and advanced model evaluation part, which was also feedback from the tutor that I needed to develop. Additionally, encountering other regression models, like decision trees, was notable. In terms of formative tasks, I found the Plotly library highly beneficial, enhancing my practical skills in creating interactive visualisations. As a result, I developed my Python programming language skills as well in this module, and since I had prior experience, I did not have any difficulties. Moreover, we covered unsupervised learning techniques such as K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering, which are also machine learning methods. These techniques were challenging to grasp, but with practice, I believe I took a good step towards laying a solid foundation for my upcoming module on machine learning. However, I recognise the need for further research and practice to solidify my understanding of these advanced topics. We also briefly looked at the future of data visualisation and the impact AR and VR will have on it. This is another proof of the continuous development of this subject, and this urged me to do more research on it. There is a consensus that data visualisation is the way of the future, and market demand for it is growing daily (Shahzad, 2024).
The skills acquired in this module are directly applicable to future projects and career aspirations. Data visualisation plays a crucial role in simplifying complex data for diverse audiences, from data scientists to business professionals, facilitating


informed decision-making (GeeksforGeeks, 2024). Moving forward, I intend to leverage these skills to create impactful visualisations that drive meaningful insights and innovations in my professional endeavours. The professional skills I developed during this module, including time management, critical thinking, and problem- solving, will guide my continued growth.
In conclusion, the data visualisation module has been instrumental in enhancing my technical and soft skills, and proficiency in data science. I am committed to advancing my expertise in machine learning and applying these techniques to create innovative and impactful data visualisations. This reflective journey has reaffirmed my passion for data science and my readiness to contribute meaningfully to the field's advancement.
